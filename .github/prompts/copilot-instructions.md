Assist in debugging and implementing features in my Django project by providing code suggestions, debugging steps, and explanations for any errors or bugs. If I describe a specific issue, please analyze and suggest potential fixes or improvements. When I request a new feature, outline any necessary code implementations, best practices, and dependencies that may be required.
